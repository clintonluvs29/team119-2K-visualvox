### Introduction
Everyday, there a millions of data being transmitted as images. As the saying goes, "an image speaks a thousand words". If there is a way to summarize all our images, and even charts, into sentences and paragraphs, we will obtain unprecedented pools of useful data for machine learning and could even achieve potential breakthroughs.

### Brief
This tool allows tranformation of images into text. 

For instance, the image

corresponds to
‘general_description‘: ‘An orange tabby cat is lying down, facing the camera with a focused expression against a blue background’.
‘cat’: ‘The orange tabby cat is in the center of the frame, lying down and looking directly into the camera with large, round green eyes.’
‘environment’: ‘The simple blue background provides a clear, undistracted view focusing on the cat’.

Uses are varied and are not limited to:
- Providing users with an audio description of their surroundings
- Aiding the visually impaired in viewing the physical world, as well as the multimedia digital world
- Generating audiobooks based on their surroundings immediately, serving as entertainment
- Providing further prompts to generate other multimedia. Hence, providing artworks based on real-life images.

### Essay description
VisualVox takes an image - be it from a camera or an upload - and turns it into a short story that is limited to 100 words.

**For instance, when we provide an image of a tabby cat, it tells us: 
‘general_description‘: ‘An orange tabby cat is lying down, facing the camera with a focused expression against a blue background’.
‘cat’: ‘The orange tabby cat is in the center of the frame, lying down and looking directly into the camera with large, round green eyes.’
‘environment’: ‘The simple blue background provides a clear, undistracted view focusing on the cat’.

It is precise to the point where one can imagine the image based on the word descriptions alone. 

An immediate use for our product will be to provide audio cues for the visually impaired. VisualVox can almost help the visually impaired 'see the world', be it the real world or the digital. The experience of the visually impaired definitely could be enhanced, be it navigating their physical surroundings or access the colorful digital world that has taken over a large part of our lives. Using VisualVox, they will be able to access the multimedia on our social media and websites, enabling them to catch up with society and enable their participation in society and lives.

Next, there are many uses of turning text into images, for instance DALL-E using stable diffusion methods. However, there is yet to be tools that can reliably turn images into text. One usage for such texts could then be that they can be used as prompts to other stable diffusion engines to produce images. As a result, we are able to use images as a "prompt" that generate abstract artworks and concepts. Imagine being able to use a photo of Niagara Falls and immediately receiving a Monet-like oil painting of it. Or taking a picture of Harry Potter and receiving a cartoon redrawing of him. This could also serve for entertainment purposes. Users can point their camera at their surroundings and hear an audiobook being generated based on their surroundings. They could even upload their social media posts and videos and immediately receive a plausible photo caption or background music idea.
